# [Anyhow](https://docs.rs/anyhow/latest/anyhow/)

**Anyhow** is a library for flexible error handling in Rust, providing a simple anyhow::Error type that can wrap any error implementing std::error::Error. It is designed for applications where type-safe error handling is less critical than ease of use.

## Best Uses:

- Simplified Error Handling in Applications:
  - Using anyhow::Error as a catch-all error type in main or other application code to avoid defining custom error types.
  - Example: A CLI tool that aggregates errors from multiple sources (e.g., file I/O, network requests).
- Adding Context to Errors:
  - Using anyhow::Context to attach additional information to errors without defining custom types.
  - Example: Wrapping a network error with context like “failed to fetch user data”.
- Prototyping or Small Projects:
  - Quickly handling errors in early development or scripts where defining custom error types is overkill.
  - Example: A script that performs file operations and HTTP requests with minimal error handling boilerplate.
- Combining Heterogeneous Errors:
  - Handling errors from different libraries (e.g., std::io::Error, reqwest::Error) in a single Result type.
  - Example: A tool that reads configuration files and makes API calls, unifying all errors under anyhow::Error.

## When to Use:

- Use Anyhow in applications (not libraries) where you want simple, flexible error handling without the need for strongly-typed errors.
- Ideal for rapid development, prototyping, or when error details are less critical than ease of use.
