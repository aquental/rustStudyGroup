# Smart Home

system where various smart home devices can be controlled with different actions using a remote control.
The system should be easily extensible and maintainable.

## Problem Requirements:

- Each device should have specific actions such as turning on or turning off. For simplicity, print a message indicating the action taken.
- It should be possible to change the actions of a device without altering the existing codebase.
- The device-control logic should be easily testable and maintainable.
- You need to choose between two design patterns: Command or Strategy depending on the requirements, and implement the system accordingly.

## Command Pattern:

This pattern encapsulates a request (e.g., turning a device on or off) as an object, allowing you to parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.

Itâ€™s ideal for scenarios where actions are discrete commands that can be issued, stored, or modified independently.

The Command pattern is the better choice for this use case because it:

- Encapsulates individual actions (turn on, turn off) as command objects, making them modular and reusable.
- Allows adding new actions (e.g., restart) without modifying existing code, adhering to the Open/Closed Principle.
- Supports easy testing of individual commands and the controller, as shown in the test cases.
- Provides flexibility for runtime command management (e.g., queuing or executing commands dynamically).
- Keeps the codebase maintainable by isolating action logic in separate command structs.
