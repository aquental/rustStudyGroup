# Builder Pattern

This pattern is designed for constructing complex objects step-by-step, allowing fine-grained control over the construction process.  
It’s ideal when an object like Robot has multiple properties (robot_type, material) that need to be set explicitly and may require validation or flexibility in how they’re assigned.

Create a Robot that has robot_type and material properties.

- Ensure that the values are provided in the main code, where robot_type will be "Android" and material will be "Steel".
